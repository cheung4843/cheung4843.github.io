      <description>10107 - What is the Median? Median plays an important role in the world of statistics. By definition, it is a value which divides an array into two equal parts. In this problem you are to determine the current median of some long integers. Suppose, we have five numbers {1,3,6,2,7}. In this case, 3 is the median as it has exactly two numbers on its each side. {1,2} and {6,7}. If there are even number of values like {1,3,6,2,7,8}, only one value cannot split this array into equal two parts, so we consider the average of the middle values {3,6}.</description>
